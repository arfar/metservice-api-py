Minimal Metservice API in Python
================================

Wrote this because [Metservice](http://metservice.com) doesn't have an API
and I wanted to keep track of Christchurch's weather.

REALLY simple and only gets the current information regarding wind,
temperature and rainfall. Current means "within the last hour" to metservice.

Just requires [Ghost.py](http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/)

Usage
=====

Call the function a receive a dictionary of various weather related items.

or use:

    python metservice.py christchurch
    python metservice.py wellington/western-hills
